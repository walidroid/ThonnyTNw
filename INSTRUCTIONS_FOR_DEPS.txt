PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

To fix the installation, you must replace the contents of the 'depsx64' folder.
Currently, it contains 'pyinstaller.exe' which is incorrect. It needs to contain the Python Wheel files.

1. Go to the 'depsx64' folder in your project (`c:\Users\Walid\Desktop\ThonnyTNw\depsx64`).
2. Delete the 'pyinstaller' folder/exe inside it.
3. Download the following files from PyPI (https://pypi.org) and place them directly into `depsx64`:

   - pyinstaller (Wheel ending in .whl, e.g., pyinstaller-X.X.X-py3-none-win_amd64.whl)
   - pyinstaller-hooks-contrib (Wheel)
   - altgraph (Wheel)
   - pefile (Wheel)
   - pywin32-ctypes (Wheel)

Ensure you get the versions compatible with Python 3.10 (or whatever version Thonny bundles).
Once these files are in 'depsx64', rebuild your installer using Inno Setup.
